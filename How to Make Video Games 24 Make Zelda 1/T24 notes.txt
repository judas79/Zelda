https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJn6ePiUQr4&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=25

This is the first part of my video series in which I will make a Legend of Zelda clone. 
I get asked all the time to cover how to make pixel art, so I値l cover that first. 
I値l show exactly how I drew Link and then I値l draw a ground sprite as well. 
We値l also look at the finished sprite sheet I値l use for the game. 
The sprite sheet is available here for free download.

In the videos that follow I値l make a fully functioning Zelda clone. 
It will be a ton of fun!

In this tutorial, we used Gimp and a picture of the main Zelda character 'Link', 
and made a 16x16 sprite rendition, of it.  We also made some background flowers,
for part of the background, for the game.

Then in the Assets folder, we created a folder and named it Sprites, then downloaded the sprite sheet,
in the link above, and dragged it in there.
