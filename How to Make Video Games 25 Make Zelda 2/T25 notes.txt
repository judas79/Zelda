How to Make Video Games 25 : Make Zelda 2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4wvPA9Gfs&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=25

In this part of my Video Game Tutorial I’m going to setup all of my Zelda clones assets and create the entire board. 
These techniques can be utilized to make games in multiple frameworks. In a future video I’ll also show you how to do this in a Unity centric way,
using a program called the Tiled Map Editor.
http://www.newthinktank.com/2017/10/make-video-games-25/

All of the sprites are available here in a free download. Feel free to do what ever you want with them, 
but be aware that most everything is based on a Nintendo property, 
so I don’t own anything.

****************************** general game setup *****************************

********************************** Sprite setup *******************************

If you haven't already, in Unity create a new 2d project, in the unity subfolder named Zelda.

Within the Unity editor, in the Assets folder, create new folders:
Animations
Prefabs
Scenes
Scripts
Sounds
Sprites

Drag the Dereks' 16x16Sprites sheet, into the Sprites folder.
With the 16x16Sprites sheet selected, set the settings:
sprite mode = multiple
pixels per unit = 16
filter mode = point
compression = high quality

Next in the 16x16Sprites sheet settings click the sprite editor, button.
Click apply, for the popup.
In the editor, click the second 'down arrow', select:
Grid by cell size
pixel size x = 16, Y = 16
click slice
Then click Apply
Then close by clicking the 'X'


********************************** Camera Setup ***********************************

In hierarchy, select the Main Camera, and Settings:
Size = 8
This is dependant on the amount of pixels, which is 16x16

For this game we want the Camera to be located at the bottom left of our screen:
position x = -13
position y = -5

After reconsidering this; changed to:
position x = 0
position y = 0

Leave backgoround the same for now.


******************************** create empties *********************************

Next we will create a bunch of empties, for all our sprites.
We will create sorting layers, for these, later on.
In hierarchy,
Create Empty, rename to 'Hills'  (all of these, without quoates)
Create Empty, rename to 'Trees'
Create Empty, rename to 'Dirt'
Create Empty, rename to 'Houses'
Create Empty, rename to 'Trees'
Create Empty, rename to 'Stones'
Create Empty, rename to 'Weapon'
Create Empty, rename to 'Link'
Create Empty, rename to 'Villian'
Create Empty, rename to 'Bushes'



*********************************** Dirt prefab **********************************

From our Sprites folder, drag the 16x16Sprite_10, into the Dirt object folder in hierarchy.
We will create a Prefab out of it later.
Rename it to Dirt10, keeping the 10 at the end,as reference, to the type of dirt, basic dirt, that it is.

Make enough duplicates, of Dirt10 to make an outline of a rectangle, made from Dirt10, x = 23 by y = 28 in diameter.
About 42 of them, in total.
A cube = 16x16 pixels

x = 27 dirt cubes wide
________________________________
|								|
|								|
|								|
|                               |<- y = 23 dirt cubes
|								|
|								|
|_______________________________|


Place the firt row of dirt, starting at 0,0 then the second one, a duplictate, at 1,0 then continue to.... 23,0.
Then start the column up from there 23, 1, to... 23, 28,
Then, the next row from 22, 28 ... down to 0,28,
Then start the column down, back to 0,1.

We will set up a master game board array, later on, to put in place, where Link, the main character in Zelda,
can travel, and where he can't, so we will leave the dirt settings positions x and y at 0.


**************************************** setup Grass ************************************


In the sprites folder select 16x16sprite_15 and drag it into your Grass Empty folder in Hierarchy, and rename to Grass15.
Put it in position 0,0.

In the sprites folder select 16x16sprite_16 and drag it into your Grass Empty folder in Hierarchy, and rename to Grass16.
put it in position 1,0.

Create Empty name it Bushes, and set position to 0,0.
In the sprites folder select 16x16sprite_16 and drag it into your Bushes Empty folder in Hierarchy, and rename to Grass16.
Set position to 2.5, 0.

IT IS BEST TO HAVE THE SPRITES ASSIGNED TO A SORTING LAYER BEFORE CREATING PREFABS!
In this lesson, I made the prefabs, then had to assign the sorting layers afterward, 
one at a time, instead of selecting the prefab empty.  Pain in the ass.
Duplicate it, and in the duplicate put a check mark next to the Flip x, to flip the image.
Set position to: 1.5, 0.
Then drag the Bushes Empty, into the prefab folder.
Now drag that Bushes prefab into the Grass Empty, and align it next to the first bush we made, with Grass15 and Grass16.

Duplicate Bushes until you have a total of 5 whole ones, and the corner one, then add a half of a bush (flipped x Grass16) at the end.
See picture in ..... How to make video Games 25 .... folder.

WE will now MOVE EVERYTHING IN GRASS INTO THE HILLS Empty folder.


****************************************** Hills setup ************************************

Select everything in the Grass Empty and drag it into the Hills Empty.  The tutorial admin changed his mind, of where he wanted them.
The Grass Empty Object should be now, empty.

We will start working our way up the y axis on the left bottom side of our dirt.

Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_45 into the Hill empty, and rename to Grass45. Setting:
Position 0, 1
Duplicate it, and setting
position 0, 2

Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_38 into the Hill empty, and rename to Grass38. Setting:
position 0, 3

Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_39 into the Hill empty, and rename to Grass39. Setting:
position 1, 3

Duplicate Grass39 5 times
Position x = 2 ++1
position y = 3  for all

We will start working our way up the y axis, from where we left off with our bushes.

Dulicate Grass15, and set Flip x checked:
position 0,10

Duplicate Grass45 set flip x
position 10,1

Duplicate Grass45 7 more times and position it at x = 10, and y = ++1

We need and edge, for the hedge that is pointed from the left side to the middle ending in a duplicate of Grass39.

Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_36 into the Hill empty, and rename to Grass36. Setting:
position 0, 3

You should now have 'T25 dirt and grass 3.png' look at this picture in the tutorial 25 folder.

Next, on our own, we need to fill it in ourselves, so that it looks like the two images ...T25 dirt and grass 3.png.



*********************************** sorting layers **************************************


First, we will make a whole bunch of sortings layers, so that layers, at the bottom,
are covered up, by layers, on the top, if any.

Select one of the Grass sprites within Hills, and click on Sorting Layer,
then choose Add sorting layer, from the drop down.  
Hit the + button to add the following list of layer components, in this order:

Dirt
Grass
Hill
Tree
House
Stone
Weapon
Villian
Link

Next, select all those sprites, in the Hills in hierarchy, including all those grass sprites,
and in the sorting layer dropdown select Hills.
If you made prefabs, Select the prefabs, some at a time, or all of them, then right click and choose,
select children, then with CTrl pressed, click all the parent folders (prefab roots),
and you will get the sorting property, for that selected children, to chose your sorting layer.

Do the same for the Dirt Empty(s), contents, but set the sorting layer to Dirt.


********************************* Grass area ********************************


Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_25 into the Hill empty, and rename to Grass25. Setting:
Sorting Layer = Hill
position 0, 4
Fill in that peninsula area with this Grass

Do the same with Grass25 starting at:
position 14,0
and work your way up.


Next we will fill in dirt, see pic 'T25 where grass is going to be 5'.
Fill in dirt, in the areas as shown in the image
Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_20 into the Grass empty, and rename to Grass20. Setting:
Sorting Layer = Grass
position 12,3

Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_30 into the Grass empty, and rename to Grass30. Setting:
Sorting Layer = Grass
position 13,3

Next we will fill in the empty areas, in the dirt with this grass.
Next, lets drag 16x16sprite_83 into the Grass empty, and rename to Grass83. Setting:
Sorting Layer = Grass
position 10, 8



***************************** more dirt and hills bottom right corner *************************


Fill the bottom right corner, with more dirts, at an angle, kinda like this:  /| 
Then we will fill that area in with:
Grass20
Grass30
Grass83

Stayin on the right side, of our game play area, we will add two rows of Hills.
See "T25 Two hills on right side 5.png"

Next, on the right side of our game we will create two ridgeses of hills,
parallel to each other horrizontally, but slightley different from one another,
starting with Grass36, the right edge of the lower, ridge.


********************************* setup trees **********************************

Next, we will put some sprites together, to create a tree prefab.
First, in the Trees empty, Create Empty, inside of Trees, where we will drag our sprites into.
Name the child Empty Tree.
Lets drag in:
16x16sprite_18 
16x16sprite_19 
16x16sprite_28 
16x16sprite_29 
into the TreeSprite empty, and rename the sprites to:
Tree18
Tree19 
Tree28
Tree29
Select all 4 of these, setting
Sorting Layer = Tree
Verify, that the Trees, and Tree Empties, are set to 0,0.
Set the positions for the 4 Tree Sprites, to make a tree, from the four parts.
Tree18 0,1
Tree19 1,1
Tree28 0,0
Tree29 0,1
Select the Tree empty and drag them into the prefab folder, then delete the Tree empty,
and drag the Tree Prefab back into the Treees empty.

Next, drag your tree, to the top right side of our gaming are, make a copy of it, and put it,
to the left of that first one.  My positions are:
24,19
19,22
16,22
As everything in the land map, put it where it looks good...


*********************************** leaves, stumps, flowers and rocks as dirt *************************************
