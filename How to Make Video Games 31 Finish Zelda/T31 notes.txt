Thank you for the tutorial. i hoped to see you implement simple behaviors on enemy like chasing and attacking Link, though. 
Kind of curious on your approach.

I figured that would be good homework. Have the villain check to see if Link has a x and y position within range of the villains x and y position. 
If true then have the villain go to Links position. If Link runs away from the villain check for Links closest node and go there and there to Link. 
Have the villain attack in the same way Link attacks. I hope that helps
