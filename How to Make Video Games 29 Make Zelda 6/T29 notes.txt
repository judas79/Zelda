How to Make Video Games 29 : Make Zelda 6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvKq2-RUkjA&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=30

In this part of my How to Make Video Games series I will continue making a Zelda clone. I’ll create animations for the villains and animate them. 
I’ll also cover a new way to animate Link’s sword from inside of code. 
We’ll use coroutines to make items show and then disappear on the screen and a whole lot more.

First, change your background color in your Main Camera, to a shade of green, that looks good.


*********************************** Create Enemies (Villains) ***************************************


In the 16x16Sprite sheet select 16x16Sprite_0 and 16x16Sprite_1 and drag it into the scene Window.
Save the animation, as EnemyWalkRight, into the Animations folder.
This animation, will be used to walk left and right.
While the 16x16Sprite_0, is selected in hierarchy, Click on Window, Animation in the main menu, 
then open the Animation editor.
Expand the animation editor window and also drag it down so it is over the game Play window,
then right click its settings, the 3 dots ... and choose add tab, game to pin it next to the game play window.
For the 16x16Sprite_0, sorting layer set to villain.

Next, create empty, named Villains.
Positions 0,0,0
Drag 16x16Sprite_0 into Villains.
Rename 16x16Sprite_0 to Villain.
Position Villain 6,2
In the animator editor, slow down the speed of the animation:
speed = .3

Next, in animation editor, make a new animation:
choose:  Make new clip... from the drop down triangle.
Name it EnemyWalkLeft, in the popup diagnal, and save in Animations folder.
In the Animation editor set the number space to 2, then drag 16x16Sprite_0, in the first division,
of the screen on the right, and 16x16Sprite_1 into the second part of the screen.
In, animator editor, select EnemyWalkLeft, and change speed to .3.
In, animations select villain, then flip x by checking it, so the animation will flip the EnemyWalkLeft animation.

Next, do the same steps as above, using 16x16Sprite_2, and 16x16Sprite_3, and name it:
EnemyMoveDown.  But, do not flip the x axis.

Next, do the same steps as above, using 16x16Sprite_4, and name it:
EnemyMoveUp.  But, do not flip the x axis.

Next, do the same steps as above, using 16x16Sprite_2 (put it in twice), and name it:
EnemyIdle.  But, do not flip the x axis.

Next, select the Animation folder, and rename the 16x16Sprite_0 controller to Enemy.

Next, click on Villain, and add a boxcollider 2d, also notice the Controller is now named Enemy.
Change the size, of the Boxcollider 2d to:
Size : .7 x .7
Next, ad a rigidbody 2d, with settings:
mass .0001
gravity scale 0
collision detection Continous
freeze rotation z checked


********************************** Villains border points and script **********************************


Next, we will create to create empties, to set the points where the Villain will travel,
back and forth, between.
Name the first Empty VillainStart, and the second one, VillainEnd,
then drag them into the Villains Empty.
Use the picture of the cube dropdowns, to mark our VillianStart and VillainEnd empties, so we can see them.
Since our Villain starting position is at 6,2 we will put our VillainStart positions at:
position 4,2  
We will put our VillainEnd position at:
position 10,2

Put Boxcolliders 2d on each of the VillianStart and VillainEnd empties.
Set both of the Boxcollider 2ds, to the same settings.
Size x: .5 
Size y: .5
and both colliders settings are also:
is trigger = checked

Next, create a script and name it Villain.  
We, should first ask ourselves, what do we need to track, for the Villain to perfom correctly,
double click Villain script, and we will continue in VS...

After saving, and returning after getting to the else in the OnTriggerEnter2D statement,
Drag our Villian script into out Villain, in hierarchys, settings,
try out our Game to see if the Villain moves, back and forth.



*************************************** Links Sword weapon *****************************************


Next we will attach a Sword animation (weapon) to Link, in a new way.
Create empty, name it Weapon, and drag it into Link. position 0,0
Select 16x16Sprite_81 and drag it into Weapon.
Rename it to Sword.
Sword sorting layer = Link
In the scene area, click the two circular arrow tool, then in the scene window, 
drag the sword around, so that it is facing down, or do the same thing by setting.
Rotation z = -180
If the sword is behind link, set the 'Order in layer' the same as Links, order in layer.
In the sword position, set it to the nearest decimal point.
position = 1.6, -4.5

When Link attacks, the sword will then show up.

Next, add a Boxcollider2D to the sword.
To make the colllider smaller set:
offset = 0, .1
Size = .3, .8

Next, we will open the Link2 script, to make the sword show up in the right position.
Continue there...
