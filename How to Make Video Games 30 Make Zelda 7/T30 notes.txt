How to Make Video Games 30 : Make Zelda 7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgjjlZdGet8&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=30

In this part of my video game tutorial I will continue making Zelda. I’ll focus this time on something I have not covered before,
which is how to create the AI for our villain so that he will travel on his own around the game board looking for Link. 
The villain will travel around using very few system resources. He will be able to locate Link any place on the map. 
We will use multidimensional arrays to store travel nodes. We will also learn how to find out which node game objects are closest to.

********************************* Villain node navigation ***********************************


We will use create empty objects, as nodes, to navigate around our map.  The nodes will track,
their distance from link, and navigate the Villain to the nearest node to Link, by using,
line of sight, between the nodes, to get to Link.

First, we will place nodes, all around the map, in a line of sight, method.
Create empty, to hold all the Empty node objects, and name it TravelNodes.
position 0, 0

Create empty, name it Node0 and add a collider 2d, then put it inside of TravelNodes.
check is trigger setting
Size: .2, .2
offset Y = .25
The offset is so our Villian doesn't run it to the nodes.
Then pic a color, from the cube option, to mark the node.
Position the node at the starting position of Link 2, -4

Next, add a tag to Node0 and name it VillainNode, and attach all your nodes to it.

Make 10 more of these, and spread them in line of site, throughout your game map..
These are the node Positions, starting with Node0:
 2, -4
11, -4
 9,  0
 2,  6
 2, 16
 8, 15
 5, 11
 5,  9
16,  9
20, 16
27, 10
25,  2
21,  5


**************************** write Villain node navigation code *****************************


Think about things we need to add to Villain, to make it work.
We want the Villain to navigate around the entire map area, so we will create nodes,
that the Villain will go between, in line of site, until it gets close to link.
Then the Villain can attack link.
A node array, contain all of our nodes, positions.
Access to the current node.
Access to the next Node, nearest Link.

Next, double click Villain.sc script and we will continue in VS...

After, saving and returning here, run the game and see if the Villain moves forward and backwards,
between the nodes, using the f and b keys.



************************************* Villain find Link ***********************************

Things to setup:
Track the Node that Link is the closest to, using an array.
Store the Nearest Nodes location that is nearest to Link.

We will continue, in Villain.cs, writing the code that will enable to find Link...
